# Kernod

A Q&amp;A website written in C.

The Kernod project aims to create a Q&A website (something like the almighty Stack Overflow) for university students in China, and build a community around it.
We are implementing this website with the [BCHS](https://learnbchs.org) stack, because that would be much more interesing than writting one with a popular framework like Flask or Django.

The name "Kernod" stemmed from a roguelike game called Nethack, where a random scroll may be labelled [KERNOD WEL](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Scroll_origins).
